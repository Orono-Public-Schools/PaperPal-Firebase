# PaperPal — Plan

## Current Phase: Testing & Polish

- End-to-end workflow testing on production
- Verify all email notifications land correctly (submit, approve, deny, revisions, resubmit, redirect)
- Test sandbox mode with controller role
- Onboard controller user, verify final approver flow
- Clean up dead code (ThemeToggle.tsx, useTheme.ts)
- Verify form field config hides fields on FormView (read-only) too
- Update plan.md with completed work

## Up Next

- Mobile responsiveness
  - Dashboard cards layout on small screens
  - Submission rows — readable on phone
  - Form pages — input grids, signature field, file upload
  - Admin panel — tabs, accordion sections, form field editor
  - FormView — header, timeline, approval actions
  - Sidebar nav — already slides in, verify touch targets

## Future (post business office meeting)

- Notification preferences (user opt-in/out from profile)
- Reporting / analytics dashboard (totals, trends, approvals per month)
- FormView: respect form field config (hide hidden fields in read-only view)
- Light mode (requires refactoring inline styles to CSS variables)

## Done

- Resubmit bug fix (deleteField instead of undefined)
- Supervisor redirect (reassign + email notifications)
- Activity timeline (log all workflow events, vertical timeline in FormView)
- Print & export (print button, on-demand PDF via callable Cloud Function)
- Resubmit email notifications (supervisor + submitter notified)
- Controller role (restricted admin panel, Firestore rules, nav access)
- Sandbox mode (isolated test environment, emails to self, no Drive uploads)
- Form field config (admin UI to show/hide/reorder form sections)

- Dashboard UI refresh (rotate-reveal cards, gradient submission rows, form-type accents)
- History management (hide submissions, clear history, export CSV)
- Searchable staff dropdown in admin Users & Roles
